# semantic_distance

Data and code for the paper on semantic distance from colexifications

## Data from CLICS3

Data is created with

`clics colexification -t 1 -f languages`

Here, it was processed as a tsv file, in data/colexifications.tsv

We also process from infomap, to get the clusters

## Data from concepticon

The raw data from the last stable release is in data/ as well, so users
don't need to install concepticon
