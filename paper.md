## Introduction

Semantic change is a linguistic phenomenon of change in meaning of vocabulary
through time. Common English examples include
*awesome*, originally ``inspiring awe; feaful'' and today usually
``exciting, excellent'', and  *villain*, originally ``countryman, serf''
and now ``scoundrel, vile'', and dog/hound. Routinely investigated
in fields like semantics and semasiology, with a number of of typologies
presented in terms of narrowing and widening of meanings, metaphors and
metonyms, folk-etymologies, and similar (cf. Bloomfield 1933, Blank 1999),
the topic is of particular relevance for comparative linguistics,
as a much followed principle is one that, given the easiness of finding
chance resemblances and the general unpredicatibility of the change,
one should only compare words with the same meaning unless there is
clear support for a semantic leeway.

Studies on the topic tend to be restricted to individual words and
etymological dictionaries, along with the aforementioned typological debate
and investigations on the linguistic, psychological, and sociocultural
sources for semantic change, as in Blank (1999) and Grzega (2004).
Quantitative investigations tend to concentrate in the related problem
of semantic similarity, where distances are usually calculated in terms
of... for purpose such sa word sense disambiguation, spelling and speech
recognition correction, etc. [saifmohammad]

Here we offer a dimensionless and relative distnace for the
comparative concepts in Cocncepticon, computed from a cross-linguistic
collection of colexifications. The distances are intended to help
the expansion of approaches of computer-assisted language comparison.

- want to be based in empirical data, if not, so that competing approaches
can be compared and measured

## What we did

hypothesis that there is first a moment of polysemy (what about loans?)

We introduce a dimensionless and relative distance between concepts


Not correcting by local occurrences, to get a ratio, because this would
get all concepts equally alike, and some are too specific (it probably
also mimicks the semantic shift in nature among more common and
general topics)

## Conclusion

this is symmetrical, which might be good or bad, but it is clearly not
the same as in sound laws
